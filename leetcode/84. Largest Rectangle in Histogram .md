# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
### hard

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 


Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

 


The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

 

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

```java
class Solution {
    // monotonic stack (increasing)
    // from left to right we keep the heights in an increasing order.
    // if we don't have a shorter one, that means res could be still growing
    // On time On space
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        int res = 0;
        Deque<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= heights.length; i++) {
            // deal with the edge case if the given heights is all the way increasing
            int curHeight = (i == heights.length)? -1: heights[i];
            // if we encounter a shorter colomn, it's time we check and update the res
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && curHeight < heights[stack.peek()]) {
                int h = heights[stack.pop()];
                // Here we don't have any more taller building in between, so it's safe that this height is the smallest in this interval.
                int w = stack.isEmpty()? i: i - stack.peek() - 1; 
                res = Math.max(res, h * w);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
