# 895. Maximum Frequency Stack
### hard
Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 

Example 1:

Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
 

Note:

Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.
```python
class FreqStack:
    # Similar to LFU. Difference is that we don't need to adjust the position of element in different buckets.
    def __init__(self):
        self.freq = collections.defaultdict(list)
        self.count = collections.defaultdict(int)
        self.maxFreq = 0

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        f = self.count[x]
        self.freq[f+1].append(x)
        self.count[x] += 1
        self.maxFreq = max(self.maxFreq, f+1)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        ret = self.freq[self.maxFreq].pop()
        self.count[ret] -= 1
        if not self.freq[self.maxFreq]:
            self.maxFreq -= 1
        return ret
        


# Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = FreqStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
```
