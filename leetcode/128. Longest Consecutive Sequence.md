### hard

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(*n*) complexity.

**Example:**

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```



```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: 'List[int]') -> 'int':
        res = 0
        dic = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in dic:
                # Search for consecutive digit and gets the length
                if (num-1) in dic:
                    left = dic[num-1]
                else:
                    left = 0
                if (num+1) in dic:
                    right = dic[num+1]
                else:
                    right = 0
                # Get the new length
                temp = left + right + 1
                dic[num] = temp
                # Update the result
                res = max(res, temp)
                # update both ends of the result
                dic[num-left] = temp
                dic[num+right] = temp
        return res
```
