# 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
### hard
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.


```Java
class Solution {
    // Sliding window 
    // maintain a window of size k, and make sure that distinct num is less or equal than k.
    // Once we reach k, we have to reduce the size by incrementing left bound until the distinct count reach 0.
    // On time O n space
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
        int[] count = new int[256];
        int res = 0, curDistinct = 0, i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            if (count[s.charAt(j)]++ == 0) curDistinct++;
            if (curDistinct > k) {
                while (--count[s.charAt(i++)] > 0); // cut the number of distinct number
                curDistinct--;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, j - i +1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
