# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
### medium
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:

Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

```Java
class Solution {
    // dp on time o1 space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell = 0;
        int prev_buy = 0, prev_sell = 0;
        for (int price: prices) {
            prev_buy = buy;
            buy = Math.max(prev_sell - price, prev_buy);
            prev_sell = sell;
            sell = Math.max(prev_buy + price, prev_sell);
        }
        return sell;
    }
}
```

```python
class Solution1:
    # General case
    # dp(i, k, 1) = max(dp(i-1-cd, k, 0) - p[i], dp(i-1, k, 1))
    # dp(i, k, 0) = max(dp(i-1, k, 1) + p[i], dp(i-1, k, 0))
    # Here all we need is dp(i-1-cd, k, 0), dp(i-1, k, 0) and dp(i-1, k, 1)
    # Thus we need buy, sell[i-1] and sell[i-1-cd]
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        cd = 1
        n = len(prices)
        buy = float('-inf')
        sell = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            sell[i] = max(buy + prices[i-1], sell[i-1])
            buy = max(sell[i-1-cd] - prices[i-1], buy)
        return sell[n]
            
class Solution:
    # On time o 1 space
    # cd = 1 case
    # dp(i, k, 1) = max(dp(i-2, k, 0) - p[i], dp(i-1, k, 1))
    # dp(i, k, 0) = max(dp(i-1, k, 1) + p[i], dp(i-1, k, 0))
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
