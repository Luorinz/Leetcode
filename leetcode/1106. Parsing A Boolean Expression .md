# 1106. Parsing A Boolean Expression
### hard
Return the result of evaluating a given boolean expression, represented as a string.

An expression can either be:

"t", evaluating to True;
"f", evaluating to False;
"!(expr)", evaluating to the logical NOT of the inner expression expr;
"&(expr1,expr2,...)", evaluating to the logical AND of 2 or more inner expressions expr1, expr2, ...;
"|(expr1,expr2,...)", evaluating to the logical OR of 2 or more inner expressions expr1, expr2, ...
 

Example 1:

Input: expression = "!(f)"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: expression = "|(f,t)"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: expression = "&(t,f)"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: expression = "|(&(t,f,t),!(t))"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= expression.length <= 20000
expression[i] consists of characters in {'(', ')', '&', '|', '!', 't', 'f', ','}.
expression is a valid expression representing a boolean, as given in the description.


```python
class Solution:
    # stack solution
    # On time On space
    # store the operands and operators in 2 stacks. operands need to be placed in different levels.
    def parseBoolExpr(self, s: str) -> bool:
        operandStack = [[]]
        operatorStack = []
        i, n = 0, len(s)
        while i < n:
            if s[i] in "!|&":
                operatorStack.append(s[i])
            elif s[i] in "tf":
                operandStack[-1].append(s[i] == "t")
            elif s[i] == "(":
                operandStack.append([])
            elif s[i] == ")":
                op = operatorStack.pop()
                operands = operandStack.pop()
                operandStack[-1].append(self.helper(op, operands))
            i += 1
        return operandStack[-1][0]
        
    def helper(self, operator, operands):
        if operator == "!":
            return not operands[0]
        res = operator == "&"
        for o in operands:
            if operator == "&":
                res &= o
            else:
                res |= o
        return res
```
