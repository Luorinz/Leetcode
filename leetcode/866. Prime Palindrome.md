# 866. Prime Palindrome
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

 

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 11
Example 3:

Input: 13
Output: 101
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^8
The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.



```python
class Solution:
    # One important thing: Palindrome numbers with double digits are not primes
    # abba = a*1001 + b * 110, thus abba % 11 == 0
    # So the only even digits palindrome is 11
    # Then we iterate all palindrome to find the res
    # notice how we construct palindrome str(i) + str(i)[-2::-1]
    # nsqrtn time 1 space

        if 8 <= N <= 11:
            return 11
        for i in range(1, 100000):
            palindrome = int(str(i) + str(i)[-2::-1])
            if palindrome >= N and self.isPrime(palindrome):
                return palindrome
    
    def isPrime(self, n):
        if n < 2 or n % 2 == 0:
            return n == 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
