# 962. Maximum Width Ramp
### medium

Given an array A of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which i < j and A[i] <= A[j].  The width of such a ramp is j - i.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in A.  If one doesn't exist, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.
Example 2:

Input: [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.
 

Note:

2 <= A.length <= 50000
0 <= A[i] <= 50000


```Java
class Solution {
    // On time On space
    public int maxWidthRamp(int[] A) {
        int res = 0, n = A.length;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        // maintain a decreasing stack
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || A[stack.peek()] > A[i]) stack.push(i);
        }
        // Starting from the right, we check every item to find the furthest pair.
        // if i <= res, that means we cannot get an answer that's bigger than res(res - 0 = res)
        for (int i = n-1; i > res; i--) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && A[stack.peek()] <= A[i]) res = Math.max(res, i - stack.pop());
        }
        return res;
    }
}
