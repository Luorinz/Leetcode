# 286. Walls and Gates
### medium
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example: 
```
Given the 2D grid:

INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```

```Java
class Solution {
    // Omn time O m*n space
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if (rooms == null || rooms.length == 0) return;
        int m = rooms.length, n = rooms[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (rooms[i][j] == 0) {
                    helper(rooms, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void helper(int[][] rooms, int i, int j) {
        int m = rooms.length, n = rooms[0].length, val = rooms[i][j];
        int[][] DIR = new int[][] {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int r = i + DIR[k][0];
            int c = j + DIR[k][1];
            if (r < 0 || r >= m || c < 0 || c >= n ) continue;
            int cur = rooms[r][c];
            if (cur > val+1) {
                rooms[r][c] = val+1;
                helper(rooms, r, c);
            }
        }
    }
}
