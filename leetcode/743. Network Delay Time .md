# 743. Network Delay Time
### medium

There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

Note:

N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.
 

 ```java
 class Solution {
    // translate the question into if the node K can access to every other node, and return the fartherest distance
    // first build the dp that describes each node's distance to K
    // then find the longest path.
    // O (VE) time, O V space
    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {
        if (times == null || times.length == 0) return -1;
        int[] dp = new int[N+1];
        for (int i = 0; i < N+1; i++) {
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        dp[K] = 0;
        
        // From distance 0 to distance N-1( distance means physical distance between nodes)
        // record the minimum distance from node i to node K
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int[] time: times) {
                int u = time[0], v = time[1], w = time[2];
                if (dp[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dp[v] > dp[u] + w) {
                    dp[v] = dp[u] + w;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < N+1; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, dp[i]);
        }
        return res == Integer.MAX_VALUE? -1: res;
        
    }
}
 ```


 ```Python

    # O e + vlogv time O v+e space
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], N: int, K: int) -> int:

        q = [(0, K)]
        distance = {}
        adjList = defaultdict(list)
        # Make adjacency list
        # O e time
        for u, v, w in times:
            adjList[u].append((v, w))
        # O vlogv + e time
        while q:
            # Get the currently closest node to K
            dist, node = heapq.heappop(q)
            if node not in distance:
                distance[node] = dist
                for v, w in adjList[node]:
                    heapq.heappush(q, (dist+w, v))
        return max(distance.values()) if len(distance) == N else -1;
