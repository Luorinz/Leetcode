# 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order
### Hard
Given a string s, return the last substring of s in lexicographical order.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: The substrings are ["a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The lexicographically maximum substring is "bab".
Example 2:

Input: "leetcode"
Output: "tcode"
 

Note:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.

```python
class Solution:
    # Kind of greedy
    # Key is to find the max starting char, and choose the whole substring starting with it, which will always be the biggest choice
    # Then continuously check and avoid the duplicates.
    # On time On space
    def lastSubstring(self, s):
        maxChar = "a"
        maxRes = ""
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if s[i] >= maxChar and s[i:] > maxRes:  # e.g. acxxx and abxxx case
                maxChar = s[i]
                maxRes = s[i:]
            while i+1 < n and s[i] == s[i+1]:
                i += 1
            i += 1
        return maxRes
