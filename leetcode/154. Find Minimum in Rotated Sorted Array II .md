# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
## hard
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Note:

This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
```java
class Solution {
    // binary search
    // olgn time o1 space
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null) return 0;
        int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
        int lo = 0, hi = nums.length-1;
        while (left + 1 < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) right = mid;
            else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) left = mid;
            else right--;
        }
        if (nums[left] > nums[right]) return nums[right];
        return nums[left];
    }
} 
```
