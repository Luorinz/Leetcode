# 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum
### medium
Given an integer array A, you partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most K.  After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], K = 3
Output: 84
Explanation: A becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
 

Note:

1 <= K <= A.length <= 500
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6

```python
class Solution:
    # Onk time On space
    def maxSumAfterPartitioning(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for _ in range(len(A) + 1)]
        for i in range(len(A)):
            curMax = 0
            # searching backwards up until k, to update the current dp val
            for k in range(1, min(K, i+1)+1):
                curMax = max(curMax, A[i-k+1])
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-k] + curMax * k)
        return dp[len(A)-1]
```
