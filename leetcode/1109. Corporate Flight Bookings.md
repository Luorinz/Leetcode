# 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings
### medium
There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.

Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

 

Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
 

Constraints:

1 <= bookings.length <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000


```python
class Solution1:
    # TLE
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for booking in bookings:
            s = booking[0]
            t = booking[1]
            val = booking[2]
            for i in range(s, t+1):
                res[i-1] += val
        return res

    # we have 111

    # The variance is 1 _ _ -1
    #                   2 _ _ -2
    # res is          1 3 3 2 0, which is 1332
