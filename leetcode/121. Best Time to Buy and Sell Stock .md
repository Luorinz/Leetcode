# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## easy
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

```java
class Solution1 {
    // dp
    // On time On space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) return 0;
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        dp[0][1] = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int curMin = Math.min(prices[i], dp[i-1][1]);
            int curDif = prices[i] - curMin;
            int curRes = Math.max(curDif, dp[i-1][0]);
            res = Math.max(res, curRes);
            dp[i][0] = curRes;
            dp[i][1] = curMin;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
class Solution {
    // dp
    // On time O1 space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) return 0;
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int curMin = prices[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            curMin = Math.min(curMin, prices[i]);
            res = Math.max(res, prices[i] - curMin);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

    # O n time O n space
    # General case

    # dp(ith day, kth trade, sell) = max(dp(i-1 day, kth trade, buy) + p[i], dp(i-1 day, k trade, sell))

    # all we need is buy[i-1], sell[i-1]. 
    # Since we need to use buy[i-1] to update buy[i] later, we update sell[i] first

        buy, sell = float('-inf'), 0

        return sell
