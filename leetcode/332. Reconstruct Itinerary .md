# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
### medium
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
Example 1:

Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
Example 2:

Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.


```Java
class Solution {
    // This is similar to post order traversal, after we get to the end of one route, we add the nodes into the res
    // In this process, we start from JFK, find the smallest lexico order neighbour first, and continue finding until we get a route
    // We might have duplicates, but the priorityqueue will take care of it. 
    // O v+e time, O v+e space
    Map<String ,PriorityQueue<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    List<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        for (List<String> ticket: tickets) {
            String u = ticket.get(0);
            String v = ticket.get(1);
            map.putIfAbsent(u, new PriorityQueue<>());
            map.get(u).offer(v);
        }
        visit("JFK");
        return res; 
    }
    
    public void visit(String u) {
        while (map.containsKey(u) && !map.get(u).isEmpty()) {
            visit(map.get(u).poll());
        }
        res.add(0, u);
    }
}
```
