# 456. 132 Pattern
### medium
Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

Note: n will be less than 15,000.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].


```java
class Solution {
    // monotonic stack (decreasing)
    // we maintain a monotonic stack from the right
    // basically s3 is the current second maximum num from the right, s2 is the maximum number for now
    // and we just need to find a s1 to make s1 < s3, and we're done.
    // e.g. 3, 1, 4, 2
    // when it comes to 4, 2, we have stack [4] and s3 = 2. Here we have s2 = 4 and s3 = 2
    // then we get s1 = 1 < s3. and return the right answer
    public boolean find132pattern(int[] nums) {
        int s3 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] < s3) return true;
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[i] > stack.peek()) {
                s3 = stack.pop();
                
            }
            stack.push(nums[i]);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
