### 75. Sort Colors

### medium

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

```python
class Solution_1:
    # 1 Pass
    # 2 ptrs, 1 tracks pos of 1, another tracks pos of 2
    # O n time O 1 space
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        start, end = 0, len(nums)-1
        i = 0
        while i <= end:
            # if nums[i] is not 1, then need to switch position
            # Case where switch to the end
            while nums[i] == 2 and i < end:
                nums[i], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[i]
                end -= 1
            # Case where switch to the front
            while nums[i] == 0 and i > start:
                nums[i], nums[start] = nums[start], nums[i]
                start += 1
            i += 1
class Solution_2:
    # 2 pass algorithm: counting sort
    # O n time, m + n space(only need to store two countings here)
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        num_0, num_1, num_2 = 0, 0, 0
        for i in nums:
            if i == 0:
                num_0 += 1
            elif i == 1:
                num_1 += 1
            else:
                num_2 += 1
        ind = 0
        for i in range(num_0):
            nums[ind] = 0
            ind += 1
        for i in range(num_1):
            nums[ind] = 1
            ind += 1
        for i in range(num_2):
            nums[ind] = 2
            ind += 1

```
