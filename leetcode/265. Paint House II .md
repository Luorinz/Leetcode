# 265. Paint House II
### Hard
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

```python
class Solution1:
    # dp Onk^2 time O nk space
    def minCostII(self, costs) -> int:
        if not costs or not costs[0]:
            return 0
        n, k = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(k)] for _ in range(n)]
        for j in range(k):
            dp[0][j] = costs[0][j]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(k):
                for p in range(k):
                    if j == p:  # search all previous state
                        continue
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][p] + costs[i][j])
        return min(dp[n-1])

                if j != last1:
                    costs[i][j] += costs[i-1][last1] if last1 >= 0 else 0
                else:
                    costs[i][j] += costs[i-1][last2] if last2 >= 0 else 0
                if min1 < 0 or costs[i][j] < costs[i][min1]:

                    min2 = j
        return costs[n-1][min1]
