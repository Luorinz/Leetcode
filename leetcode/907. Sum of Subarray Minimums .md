# 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums
### medium
Given an array of integers A, find the sum of min(B), where B ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of A.

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: 17
Explanation: Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3,1], [1,2], [2,4], [3,1,2], [1,2,4], [3,1,2,4]. 
Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.  Sum is 17.
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 30000
1 <= A[i] <= 30000

class Solution:
    # 2 monotonic stack
    # O n time O n space
    # why this works? see this example
    # [2, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 1] 
    # for 3 left min is 2, right min is 1
    # The distance is 4 and 3
    # the # of subarrays where 3 is the min are 4 * 3
    # Because we have 4 choices(including 3) of subarrays start at x and 3 choices(including 3) of subarrs end at y
    # Thus we have res = sum(A[i]*left[i]*right[i] )
    # to Get the prevMin and nextMin, to acoid duplciate, we set one to be strictly less and the other is not

        prevMins = [-1 for _ in range(len(A))]

        stack = []
        for i in range(len(A)):
            # construct prevMins, the stack has to be increasing
            while stack and A[i] <= A[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            prevMins[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
            stack.append(i)
        stack = []

                stack.pop()
            nextMins[i] = stack[-1] if stack else len(A) # if next min doesn't exist, use a unreachable val
            stack.append(i)
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            res += ((i - prevMins[i]) * (nextMins[i] - i) * A[i])
        return res % (10**9 + 7)
