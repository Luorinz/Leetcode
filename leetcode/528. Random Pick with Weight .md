# 528. Random Pick with Weight
### medium
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

```Java
class Solution {
    Random random;
    int[] sums;
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        random = new Random();
        for (int i = 1; i < w.length; i++) {
            w[i] += w[i-1];
        }
        sums = w;
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = sums.length;
        int ind = random.nextInt(sums[len-1]) + 1;// pick a num within range (1, sum)
        int i = Arrays.binarySearch(sums, ind);// search the position closest to a random place between 1 and sum
        // i is guaranteed no bigger than total sum, so just convert to -i-1. if it's bigger, than we need to consider boundary.
        return i >= 0? i: -i-1; // binarySearch returns index to insert the searching item, need to convert to -i-1
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
