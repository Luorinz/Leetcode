# 207. Course Schedule
### medium
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

```Java
class Solution {
    // topo sort
    // O V+e time O V+E space
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<Integer>[] edges = new LinkedList[numCourses];
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) edges[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] edge: prerequisites) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            edges[v].add(u);
            indegree[u]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        }
        int count = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int cur = q.poll();
            count++;
            for (int neighbor: edges[cur]) {
                if (--indegree[neighbor] == 0) q.offer(neighbor);
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;
        
    }
}
```

            pre = edge[0]
            cur = edge[1]
            graph[pre].append(cur)
            degree[cur] += 1
        q = collections.deque()    
        # Only put 0 degree node to the q
        for i in range(numCourses):

            count += 1
            for course in graph[node]:
                degree[course] -= 1
                if degree[course] == 0:
                    q.append(course)
        return count == numCourses
