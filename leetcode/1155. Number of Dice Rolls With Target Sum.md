# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum
### medium
You have d dice, and each die has f faces numbered 1, 2, ..., f.

Return the number of possible ways (out of fd total ways) modulo 10^9 + 7 to roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals target.

 

Example 1:

Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
Example 2:

Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
Example 3:

Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 10: 5+5.
Example 4:

Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 2 faces.  There is no way to get a sum of 3.
Example 5:

Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: 
The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
 

Constraints:

1 <= d, f <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000

from functools import lru_cache

    def numRollsToTarget(self, d: int, f: int, target: int) -> int:
        res = self.helper(1, d, f, target)
        return res % (10**9 + 7)

        if target == 0:
            if curDice == d+1:
                return 1
            return 0
        if curDice == d+1:
            return 0
        temp = 0
        for num in range(1, f+1):
            if num > target:
                return temp
            temp += self.helper(curDice+1, d, f, target - num)
        return temp

    # DP
    def numRollsToTarget(self, d: int, f: int, target: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(target+1)] for _ in range(d+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, d+1):
            for j in range(1, target+1):
                for k in range(1, min(f+1, j+1)):
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-k]
        return dp[d][target] % (10 ** 9 + 7)
