# 243. Shortest Word Distance
### easy
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int pos1 = -1, pos2 = -1, res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].equals(word1)) pos1 = i;
            if (words[i].equals(word2)) pos2 = i;
            if (pos1 != -1 && pos2 != -1) {
                res = Math.min(res, Math.abs(pos1 - pos2));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
