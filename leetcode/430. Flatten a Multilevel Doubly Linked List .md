# 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
### medium
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

Example:

Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
 

 ```Java
 /*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _prev,Node _next,Node _child) {
        val = _val;
        prev = _prev;
        next = _next;
        child = _child;
    }
};

class Solution {
    // recursive
    // O branch * n time o1 space
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        Node dummy = head;
        while (head != null) {
            if (head.child != null) {
                Node sorted = flatten(head.child);
                head.child = null;
                Node curList = head.next;
                head.next = sorted;
                sorted.prev = head;
                while (sorted.next != null) sorted = sorted.next;
                sorted.next = curList;
                if (curList != null) curList.prev = sorted;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        return dummy;
        
    }
}
