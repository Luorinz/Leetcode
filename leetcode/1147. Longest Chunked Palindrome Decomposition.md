# 1147. Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition
### Hard
Return the largest possible k such that there exists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k such that:

Each a_i is a non-empty string;
Their concatenation a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k is equal to text;
For all 1 <= i <= k,  a_i = a_{k+1 - i}.
 

Example 1:

Input: text = "ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi"
Output: 7
Explanation: We can split the string on "(ghi)(abcdef)(hello)(adam)(hello)(abcdef)(ghi)".
Example 2:

Input: text = "merchant"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can split the string on "(merchant)".
Example 3:

Input: text = "antaprezatepzapreanta"
Output: 11
Explanation: We can split the string on "(a)(nt)(a)(pre)(za)(tpe)(za)(pre)(a)(nt)(a)".
Example 4:

Input: text = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can split the string on "(a)(a)(a)".
 

Constraints:

text consists only of lowercase English characters.
1 <= text.length <= 1000
