Given an array `nums` of *n* integers where *n* > 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O(*n*).

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = [1] * len(nums)
        p = 1
        # Create the base
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res[i] *= p
            p *= nums[i]
        p = 1   
        # Recreate if backwards
        for i in range(len(nums) -1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= p
            p *= nums[i]
        # for [2,3,4,5]
        # 1st time [1, 2, 6, 24] = [1, 2, 2*3, 2*3*4]
        # 2nd time [60, 40, 30, 24] = [5*4*3, 2*5*4, 2*3*5, 24]
        return res
```
