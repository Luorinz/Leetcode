# 1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval
### medium
We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

 

Example 1:

Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
 

Constraints:

1 <= hours.length <= 10000
0 <= hours[i] <= 16

class Solution1:
    # DP TLE n2
    def longestWPI(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(hours)
        nums = [1 if x > 8 else 0 for x in hours]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
        nums = [0] + nums
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i][i] = 1 if hours[i-1] > 8 else 0
        for j in range(2, n+1):
            for i in range(j-1, 0, -1):
                l = j - i + 1
                numT = nums[j] - nums[i-1]
                if numT >= l //2 + 1:
                    dp[i][j] = max(l, dp[i+1][j]+1, dp[i][j-1]+1)
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        return dp[1][n]
