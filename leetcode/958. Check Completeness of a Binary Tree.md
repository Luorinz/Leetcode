Given a binary tree, determine if it is a *complete binary tree*.

**Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:**
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

   ```python
   # Definition for a binary tree node.
   # class TreeNode:
   #     def __init__(self, x):
   #         self.val = x
   #         self.left = None
   #         self.right = None
   
   class Solution:
       ### BFS O(n)
       ### Use any() func
       def isCompleteTree(self, root):
           """
           :type root: TreeNode
           :rtype: bool
           """
           if not root:
               return False
           bfs = [root]
           i = 0
           while bfs[i]:
               bfs.append(bfs[i].left)
               bfs.append(bfs[i].right)
               i += 1
               
           # any() returns false if all elements are None
           # In here, after we get first empty node, we check if all following nodes are None
           return not any(bfs[i:])
               
   
   ```
