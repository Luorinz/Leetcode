# 632. Smallest Range
### hard
You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

Example 1:
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
Note:
The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
1 <= k <= 3500
-105 <= value of elements <= 105.
For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List<List<Integer>>. And after you reset the code template, you'll see this point.

            curNum = cur[0]
            row = cur[1]
            col = cur[2]
            if end - start > curMax - curNum:
                start = curNum
                end = curMax
            if col + 1 < len(nums[row]):
                heapq.heappush(q, (nums[row][col+1], row, col+1))
                curMax = max(curMax, nums[row][col+1])
        return [start, end]
