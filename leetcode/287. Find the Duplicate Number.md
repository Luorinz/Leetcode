### 287. Find the Duplicate Number

### medium

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

```python
class Solution_1:
    # pigeon hole principle
    # Get the mean value. the array should half exact half of the items equal to mean
    # If it exceeds, that means this part has an extra val.
    # O nlogn time O 1 sapce
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Do binary search on 1 and n
        left = 1
        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid:
                    count += 1
            if count <= mid:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left

class Solution:
    # Transfer the num list into a linked list
    # Check if it contains circle
    # O n time O 1 space
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[nums[0]]
        # Find the circle
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
        # Find the entrnce of the circle
        fast = 0
        while fast != slow:
            fast = nums[fast]
            slow = nums[slow]
        return slow
