# 761. Special Binary String
### hard
Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.
Given a special string S, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of S, and swapping them. (Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

Example 1:
Input: S = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation:
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
Note:

S has length at most 50.
S is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above.

```python
class Solution:
    # Recursion
    # Since in a special string, 1 is always more than 0, then the string must start with 1 and end with 0
    # a special string can be represented as 1 + middle + 0, middle can be anything
    # We split the special string into substrings of special string, the return the sorted version of these parts
    # For each part, we do the recursive step, find the best lexicographic combination
    def makeLargestSpecial(self, S: str) -> str:
        i = 0
        count = 0
        res = []
        for j in range(len(S)):
            cur = S[j]
            if cur == "1":
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0: # Found a special string
                res.append("1" + self.makeLargestSpecial(S[i+1:j]) +"0")
                i = j+1
        return "".join(sorted(res, reverse=True))
