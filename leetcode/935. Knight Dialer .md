# 935. Knight Dialer
### medium
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

 .           

 

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 10
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: 20
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 46
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 5000

```Java
class Solution1 {
    // Simulation 
    // O n time O 1 space
    public int knightDialer(int N) {
        long[] cur = new long[10];
        Arrays.fill(cur, 1);
        long res = 0, M = (int)1e9+7;
        for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {
            long[] next = Arrays.copyOf(cur, 10);
            next[0]=(cur[4]+cur[6])%M;
            next[1]=(cur[6]+cur[8])%M;
            next[2]=(cur[7]+cur[9])%M;
            next[3]=(cur[4]+cur[8])%M;
            next[4]=(cur[3]+cur[9]+cur[0])%M;
            next[5] = 0;
            next[6]=(cur[1]+cur[7]+cur[0])%M;
            next[7]=(cur[2]+cur[6])%M;
            next[8]=(cur[1]+cur[3])%M;
            next[9]=(cur[2]+cur[4])%M;
            cur = next;
        }
        for (long n: cur) res = (res + n) % M;
        return (int)res;
    }
}
