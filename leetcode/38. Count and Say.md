### easy

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if n == 1:
            return "1"

        prev = self.countAndSay(n-1)
        print(prev)
        i = 0
        res = ""
        while i < len(prev):
            count = 1
            while i+1 < len(prev) and prev[i] == prev[i+1]:
                count += 1
                i+=1
            res += str(count) + prev[i] 
            i+=1

        return res
```
