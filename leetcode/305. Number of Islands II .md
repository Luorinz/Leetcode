# 305. Number of Islands II
# hard
A 2d grid map of m rows and n columns is initially filled with water. We may perform an addLand operation which turns the water at position (row, col) into a land. Given a list of positions to operate, count the number of islands after each addLand operation. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:

Initially, the 2d grid grid is filled with water. (Assume 0 represents water and 1 represents land).

0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land.

1 0 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land.

1 1 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land.

1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 2
0 0 0
Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land.

1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 3
0 1 0

Can you do it in time complexity O(k log mn), where k is the length of the positions?

```java
class Solution {
    // Unionfind O klogmn time Omn space
    int[][] dirs = new int[][]{{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    public List<Integer> numIslands2(int m, int n, int[][] positions) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 0;
        int[] roots = new int[m*n];
        Arrays.fill(roots, -1);
        for (int[] p: positions) {
            int root = n * p[0] + p[1]; // means it's the root th node in the array
            if (roots[root] != -1) { // here we need to check if there's a duplicate
                res.add(count);
                continue;
            }
            roots[root] = root;
            count++;
            for (int[] dir: dirs) {
                int x = p[0] + dir[0], y = p[1] + dir[1];
                int ind = x * n + y;
                if (0 <= x && x < m && 0 <= y && y < n && roots[ind] != -1) {
                    int curRoot = find(roots, ind);
                    if (curRoot != root) { // adjacent but different group
                        roots[root] = curRoot;
                        root = curRoot;
                        count--;
                    }
                }
            }
            res.add(count);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    // quick find
    int find(int[] roots, int ind) {
        if (ind != roots[ind]) {
            roots[ind] = find(roots, roots[ind]);
        }
        return roots[ind];
    }
}
```
