# 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest 
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
to_delete.length <= 1000
to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.


```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # Recursion
    # if cur root is the root we want to delete, then we check if it's a original root, 
    # if it is an original root, but not a root to delete, that means we found the root of a part
    # if it's not the root to delete, then its children are also not the original root, but can be root to delete
    # For a root who is in the deleteList, its children should be new original root
    def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        # self.res.append(root)
        self.toDelete = set(to_delete)
        self.res = []
        self.helper(root, True)
        return self.res

    
    def helper(self, root, isRoot):
        if not root:
            return None
        isTarget = root.val in self.toDelete
        root.left = self.helper(root.left, isTarget)
        root.right = self.helper(root.right, isTarget)
        if not isTarget and isRoot:
            self.res.append(root)
        return root if not isTarget else None
