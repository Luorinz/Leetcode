# 1169. Invalid Transactions
### Easy
A transaction is possibly invalid if:

the amount exceeds $1000, or;
if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Explanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.
Example 2:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]
Example 3:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]
 

Constraints:

transactions.length <= 1000
Each transactions[i] takes the form "{name},{time},{amount},{city}"
Each {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.
Each {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.
Each {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.



```python
class Solution:
    def invalidTransactions(self, A: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n = len(A)
        invalid = [False for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            n1, t1, a1, c1 = A[i].split(",")
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                n2, t2, a2, c2 = A[j].split(",")
                if n1 == n2 and abs(int(t1) - int(t2)) <= 60 and c1 != c2:
                    invalid[j] = True
                    invalid[i] = True
            if int(a1) > 1000:
                invalid[i] = True
        res = [A[i] for i in range(n) if invalid[i]]
        return res
