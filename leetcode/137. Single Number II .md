# 137. Single Number II
### medium

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

```python
class Solution1:
    # ones and twos stand for 00 -> 01 -> 10 -> 00
    # if ones == 0, then check twos, if twos == num, get back to 0, else ones = num
    # if twos == 0, then check ones, if ones == num, then two = 0, else twos = num
    # so for every 3 same nums, ones and twos perform a cycle
    # so the single variation will be recorded
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ones = twos = 0
        for num in nums:
            ones = ones ^ num & ~twos
            twos = twos ^ num & ~ones
        return ones
    
class Solution2:
    # check two first, if one == num, two = num
    # check two, if one is 0, one = num, else one = 0
    # if one and two are both num, then three is num
    # if three is num, then reset one and two
    # every 3 same nums is a cycle
    # the single variation will be recorded
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        one = two = three = 0
        for num in nums:
            two |= one & num
            one ^= num
            three = one & two
            one &= ~three
            tow &= ~three
        return one

class Solution3:
    # O(n) time O 1 space 
    # Wrong in Python
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(32):
            temp = 0
            mask = 1 << i
            for num in nums:
                if num & mask != 0:
                    temp += 1
            print(temp)
            if temp % 3 != 0:
                res = int(res | mask)
                print(res)
        return bin(res)
        
        
```

```java
class Solution {
    // Easiest way to do it
    // On time
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            int mask = 1 << i;
            for (int num: nums) {
                if ((num & mask) != 0) temp++;
            }
            if (temp % 3 != 0) res |= mask;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
