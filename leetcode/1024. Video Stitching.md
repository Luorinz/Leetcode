# 1024. Video Stitching
### medium

Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
Example 2:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
Example 3:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
Example 4:

Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
 

Note:

1 <= clips.length <= 100
0 <= clips[i][0], clips[i][1] <= 100
0 <= T <= 100

```python
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips, T):
        dp = [float('inf') for _ in range(T+1)]
        clips.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        print(clips)
        if clips[0][0] != 0:
            return -1
        for i in range(len(clips)):
            curInterval = clips[i]
            curStart = curInterval[0]
            curEnd = curInterval[1]
            for j in range(curStart, min(T+1, curEnd+1)):
                if curStart == 0:
                    dp[j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[curStart]+1)
        if dp[T] == float('inf'):
            return -1
        return dp[T]
