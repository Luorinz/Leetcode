# 260. Single Number III
### medium
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Note:

The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

```python
class Solution:
    # O n timee O 1 space
    # make a mask of lowest 1 bit, since we get the XOR of res1 and res2, the mask digit has to be different
    # find the res1 that the digit is 0, find the res2 that the digit is 1
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        temp = 0
        for num in nums:
            temp ^= num
        mask = temp & -temp
        res1 = 0
        res2 = 0
        for num in nums:
            if (num & mask) == 0:
                res1 ^= num
            else:
                res2 ^= num
        return [res1, res2]
