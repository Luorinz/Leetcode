# 681. Next Closest Time
### medium
Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:

Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
Example 2:

Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.

    # Create all possible times and check if it's the answer
    def nextClosestTime(self, time: str) -> str:
        nums = set()
        for c in time:
            if c != ':':
                nums.add(c)
        hour, minute = time.split(":")
        for h in range(24):
            for m in range(60):
                tempM = int(minute) + 1
                tempH = int(hour)
                if tempM >= 60:
                    minute = "00"
                    tempH += 1
                else:
                    minute = str(tempM).rjust(2, "0")
                if tempH >= 24:
                    tempH = "00"
                hour = str(tempH).rjust(2, "0")
                temp = True
                for x in minute+hour:
                    temp &= x in nums
                if temp:
                    return hour + ":" + minute
                
        return time
