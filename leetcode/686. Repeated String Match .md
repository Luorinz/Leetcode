# 686. Repeated String Match
### easy
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

```java
class Solution:
    # Just check minRes(A's length should be at least equal to B's length) and minRes + 1(for case like A = s1 + s2, B = s2s1s2s1 = s2As1, then A*3 = s1s2s1s2s1s2 = s1Bs2, need an extra group.)
    # We don't have to check minRes + 2, because there is only right side we need to worry about, one more group would solve the problem.
    # O B/A time O B+A space
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A: str, B: str) -> int:
        minRes = math.ceil(len(B) / len(A))
        for i in range(2):
            if B in A * (minRes+i):
                return minRes + i
        return -1
