# 968. Binary Tree Cameras
### hard
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
Example 2:


Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # Greedy DFS
    # each root has 3 states,
    # 0 means cur root needs to be covered, 1 means cur root has a camera, 2 means cur root doesn't need to be covered
    # Every Null is a 2, don't need to be coverd
    # Every leaf is a 1, needs to be covered by its parent
    # Every parent of a leaf is a 1, since they have a child who needs covered
    # Then the parent of if becomes 2, since it have a comera node as its child, thus it doesn't need to be covered.
    # When returning, we have to check the root itself, if it's a 0, that means it need a parent that doesn't exist to cover it, thus we return res + 1. Otherwise just res.
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 2
            left, right = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            if left == 0 or right == 0:
                self.res += 1
                return 1
            if left == 1 or right == 1:
                return 2
            return 0
        return (dfs(root) == 0) + self.res
