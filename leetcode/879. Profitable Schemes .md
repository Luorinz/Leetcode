# 879. Profitable Schemes
### hard
There are G people in a gang, and a list of various crimes they could commit.

The i-th crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] gang members to participate.

If a gang member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least P profit, and the total number of gang members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: G = 5, P = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
To make a profit of at least 3, the gang could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.
Example 2:

Input: G = 10, P = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
To make a profit of at least 5, the gang could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
 

Note:

1 <= G <= 100
0 <= P <= 100
1 <= group[i] <= 100
0 <= profit[i] <= 100
1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100
 

 ```python
 class Solution:
    # DP O NGP time OGP space
    # dp[i, j] = given profit i and j people, the total number of profitable schemes
    # dp[i+p, j+g] += dp[i][j], the target we want is dp[P, _] and dp[P++, _]. Thus we combine all the answers to dp[P, _].
    # We do this backwards since we want to use each person only once, and don't want to update it by previous results
    def profitableSchemes(self, G: int, P: int, group, profit) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(G+1)] for _ in range(P+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for p, g in zip(profit, group):
            for i in range(P, -1, -1):
                for j in range(G - g, -1, -1):
                    dp[min(i+p, P)][j+g] += dp[i][j]
        return sum(dp[P]) % (10**9 +7)
