# 1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village
### Hard
There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000
wells.length == n
0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
1 <= pipes.length <= 10000
1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n
0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5
pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]


```python
import collections
import heapq
# Minimum Spanning Tree
### Same as adding a dummy node 0 that have edges to all other nodes with weight in wells[]. Then we try to build a MST with these nodes.

class Solution:
    def minCostToSupplyWater(self, n: int, wells, pipes) -> int:
        # build graph
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in pipes:
            graph[u].append([w, u, v])
            graph[v].append([w, v, u])
        for i in range(n):
            # No need to point back to 0
            graph[0].append([wells[i], 0, i+1])
            # graph[i+1].append([wells[i], i+1, 0])
        visited = {0}
        edges = graph[0]
        heapq.heapify(edges)
        res = 0
        while len(visited) < n+1 and edges:
            w, u, v = heapq.heappop(edges)
            if v not in visited:
                res += w
                visited.add(v)
                for edge in graph[v]:
                    if edge[2] not in visited:
                        heapq.heappush(edges, edge)
        return res
