# 683. K Empty Slots
### Hard
You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after N days.

You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all turned off.

If there isn't such day, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,3,2]
K: 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off bulb between them.
Example 2:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,2,3]
K: 1
Output: -1
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= bulbs[i] <= N
bulbs is a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.
0 <= K <= 20000


```python
class Solution:
    # Pretty much like a sliding window problem
    # First record which bulb is turned on on each day, then try to find an subarray such that
    # we have k+2 items in the subarray, and the items on both ends should be smaller than that in the middle
    # then we try to find this window from left to right.
    # On time On space
    def kEmptySlots(self, bulbs, K: int) -> int:
        n = len(bulbs)
        days = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for i, d in enumerate(bulbs):
            days[d-1] = i + 1
        left, right = 0, K+1
        res = n+1
        i = 0
        while i < n and right < n:
            if days[i] < days[left] or days[i] <= days[right]:
                if i == right:
                    res = min(res, max(days[left], days[right]))
                left = i
                right = K + 1 + i
            i += 1
        return res if res != n+1 else -1
