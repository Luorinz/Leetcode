# 264. Ugly Number II
### Medium
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note:  

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.

```python
class Solution:
    # dp[i] means the ith ugly number. 
    # p2, p3, p5 points to the current minimum ugly number that needs to multiply by 2, 3, 5
    # Every time we generate a smallest possible ugly number, by multiplying 2, 3, 5 from previous results.
    # e.g. 1*2, 1*3, 1*5, 2*2, 2*3, 2*5, 3*2, 3*3, 3*5...until nth.
    # if we achieve certain ugly number currently, we have to update corresponding pointer
    # e.g. when we get 6, we can get it from 2* 3 or 3 * 2, then we have to update both pointer to avoid duplicates.
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        p2, p3, p5 = 0, 0, 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = min(dp[p2] * 2, dp[p3] * 3, dp[p5] * 5)
            if dp[i] == dp[p2] * 2:
                p2 += 1
            if dp[i] == dp[p3] * 3:
                p3 += 1
            if dp[i] == dp[p5] * 5:
                p5 += 1
        return dp[n-1]
