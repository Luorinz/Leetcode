# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
### medium

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # Get the left depth, and get the right depth. if not equal, we cannot use the formula
    # If equal, the leaves are full, we can use the formula.
    # O logn*logn time, O logn space
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        left = self.getLeftDepth(root)
        right = self.getRightDepth(root)
        if left == right:   # Full subtree
            return 2 ** left - 1
        return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
    def getLeftDepth(self, root):
        d = 0
        while root:
            root = root.left
            d += 1
        return d
    def getRightDepth(self, root):
        d = 0
        while root:
            root = root.right
            d += 1
        return d
