[My Submissions](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-110/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/submissions/)[Back to Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-110/)

### Hard

Given a string `S`, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of `S` .

Since the result may be large, **return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa" and "aba".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
```

 

 

**Note:**

1. `S` contains only lowercase letters.
2. `1 <= S.length <= 2000`



```python
class Solution:       
    def distinctSubseqII(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Super amazing DP solution!
        # O(N) and O(1) Space
        # Use a list of 26 items to store the possible string ended with that letter
        end_letter = [0] * 26
        for i in S:
            # Each time the result of strings ended with current letter depends on all previous results, and update it
            # +1 means the letter it self is a solution
            end_letter[ord(i) - ord('a')] = sum(end_letter) + 1
        return sum(end_letter) % (10**9 + 7)
```
