[My Submissions](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-110/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/submissions/)[Back to Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-110/)

### Medium

Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
Output: 2
```

 

**Note**:

1. `1 <= points.length <= 500`
2. `0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000`
3. `0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000`
4. All points are distinct.
