# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
### hard
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []

```python
class Solution:
    # Check from one word to another until we get a solution
    # Intuitive solution, nearly brute force
    # O totalLen O (len(s) - totalLen) * totalLen time
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        if not words or not words[0]:
            return []
        from collections import defaultdict
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for word in words:
            counts[word] += 1
        wordLen = len(words[0])
        numWords = len(words)
        totalLen = wordLen * numWords
        res = []
        # check from 0 to max of i
        for i in range(len(s) - totalLen + 1):
            seen = defaultdict(int)
            j = 0
            # Start from i to check continuous words
            for j in range(i, i + totalLen, wordLen):
                word = s[j:j+wordLen]
                if word in counts:
                    seen[word] += 1
                    # has duplicate words
                    if seen[word] > counts[word]:
                        break
                # has irrelated words
                else:
                    break
            if seen == counts:
                res.append(i)
        return res
