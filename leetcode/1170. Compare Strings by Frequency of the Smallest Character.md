# 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character
### Easy
Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.

 

Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
 

Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 2000
1 <= words.length <= 2000
1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10
queries[i][j], words[i][j] are English lowercase letters.

```python
class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries, words):
        def f(s):
            count = collections.Counter(s)
            return count[min(s)]
        wordCount = [f(word) for word in words]
        wCount = collections.Counter(wordCount)
        res = [0 for _ in range(len(queries))]
        for i, q in enumerate(queries):
            cur = f(q)
            temp = 0
            for count in wCount:
                if cur < count:
                    temp += wCount[count]
            res[i] = temp

        return res
```
