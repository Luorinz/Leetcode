# 658. Find K Closest Elements
### medium
Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Note:
The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 104
Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 104
UPDATE (2017/9/19):
The arr parameter had been changed to an array of integers (instead of a list of integers). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
```Java
class Solution {
    // binary search. O log(n-k) + k time O k space
    // we want to find an interval of size k that satisfys
    // we assume that x lies in the middle of the interval, so we check
    // x - arr[mid] and arr[mid+k] - x
    // if first one is bigger then it means x is closer to right bound, we increment the left bound
    // if latter is bigger it means x is closer to left bound, we decrement the right bound
    public List<Integer> findClosestElements(int[] arr, int k, int x) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - k;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x) left = mid+1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        for (int i = right; i < right + k; i++) {
            res.add(arr[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
