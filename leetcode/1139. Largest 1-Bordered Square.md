# 1139. Largest 1-Bordered Square
### medium
Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the grid.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 9
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= grid.length <= 100
1 <= grid[0].length <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

class Solution:
    # O mn*min(m, n) time Omn space
    # For all submatrixes problem, we try to solve it in n^3 with optimization.
    # Always try to fix an edge(from large to small) and a point and a time, which will effectively improve the performance.
    def largest1BorderedSquare(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # Pre-process for all continuous 1s of each item
        top, left = [a[:] for a in grid], [a[:] for a in grid]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j]:
                    if i:
                        top[i][j] = top[i-1][j] + 1
                    if j:
                        left[i][j] = left[i][j-1] + 1
        for r in range(min(m, n), 0, -1): # search all possible r from large to small
            for i in range(m-r+1):
                for j in range(n-r+1):
