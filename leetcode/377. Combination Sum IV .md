# 377. Combination Sum IV
### medium
Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

```python 
class Solution1:
    # DFS + BackTrack TLE
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        self.visited = set()
        self.helper("", nums, target)
        return self.res
    def helper(self, path, nums, target):
        if target <= 0:
            if target == 0:
                self.res += 1
            return
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            temp = path + str(nums[i])
            if temp in self.visited:
                continue
            self.visited.add(temp)
            self.helper(temp, nums, target - nums[i])

class Solution:
    # Knapsack DP
    # O n^2 time O target space
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:    
        dp = [0 for _ in range(target+1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, target+1):
            for num in nums:
                if num <= i:
                    dp[i] += dp[i - num]  
        return dp[target]
