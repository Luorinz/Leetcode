# 62. Unique Paths
## medium
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1];
    }
}
```
```python
class Solution:
    # Om*n time O m*n space
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[n-1][m-1]
class Solution:
    # Om*n time O n space
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1 for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                dp[j] += dp[j-1]
        return dp[m-1]
```
