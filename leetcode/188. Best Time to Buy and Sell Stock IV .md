# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
### hard
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.


```python
class Solution:
    # Onk time Ok space
    # If k >= n // 2, it's the same as doing infinite trade
    # else, we have dp(i, k, 1), dp(i, k-1, 1), ... dp(i, 1, 1). Same as k = 2, but have more levels
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if k >= n//2:
            buy = float('-inf')
            sell = 0
            for i in range(n):
                buy = max(sell - prices[i], buy)
                sell = max(buy + prices[i], sell)
            return sell
        buy = [float('-inf') for _ in range(k+1)]
        sell = [0 for _ in range(k+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(k, 0, -1):
                sell[j] = max(buy[j] + prices[i-1], sell[j])
                buy[j] = max(sell[j-1] - prices[i-1], buy[j])
        return sell[k]
