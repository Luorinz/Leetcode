# 834. Sum of Distances in Tree
### Hard
An undirected, connected tree with N nodes labelled 0...N-1 and N-1 edges are given.

The ith edge connects nodes edges[i][0] and edges[i][1] together.

Return a list ans, where ans[i] is the sum of the distances between node i and all other nodes.

Example 1:

Input: N = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: 
Here is a diagram of the given tree:
  0
 / \
1   2
   /|\
  3 4 5
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.  Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.
Note: 1 <= N <= 10000


```python
class Solution:
    # First use a dfs(preorder) to build the count[] counting the number of nodes of each subtree
    # Then we use another dfs(postorder) to build the dist[]. dist[child] = dist[parent] - count[child] + N - count[child]
    # This means, from parent to child, we have counts[child] of nodes get 1 distance nearer, and N - counts[child] of nodes get 1 distance further.
    # On time On space
