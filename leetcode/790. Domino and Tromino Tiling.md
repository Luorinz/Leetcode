# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling
### medium
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
Note:

N  will be in range [1, 1000].
 
 ```python
 class Solution:
    # On time O 1 space
    # dp[n] = dp[n-1] + |
    #         dp[n-2] + =
    #         dp[n-3] + L + -|
    # ...
    #         dp[0] + 2
    # thus dp[0] = 2 * dp[n-1] + dp[n-3]
    """
    The answer will be a recursive sequence as follow: 1, 1, 2, 5, 11, 24, 53, 117, 258, 569, 1255
    It grows at a speed about 2 times bigger each time.
    If you write down this recursive sequence and do some calculations, you may find that:

    5 = 2 * 2 + 1
    11 = 5 * 2 + 1
    24 = 11 * 2 + 2
    53 = 24 * 2 + 5
    117 = 53 * 2 + 11
    A[N] = A[N-1] * 2 + A[N-3]

    Once you notice it, the rest work will be easy, even it may be hard to prove it.
