# 1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together
### medium
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
Example 3:

Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
 

Note:

1 <= data.length <= 10^5
0 <= data[i] <= 1

```python
class Solution:
    # sliding window
    # Basically we try to find a window which
    # 1) length is the number of 1s in the whole array. Since the result we want is a window as such.
    # 2) has most 1s. So we only need to make less moves.
    def minSwaps(self, data: List[int]) -> int:
        target = sum(data)
        left, right = -1, 0
        maxWindow, curWindow = 0, 0
        while right < len(data):
            curWindow += data[right]
            if right - left > target:
                left += 1
                curWindow -= data[left]
            maxWindow = max(maxWindow, curWindow)
            right += 1
        return target - maxWindow
