# 1125. Smallest Sufficient Team
### hard
In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people.  The i-th person people[i] contains a list of skills that person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill.  We can represent these teams by the index of each person: for example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and people[3].

Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person.

You may return the answer in any order.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]
Output: [0,2]
Example 2:

Input: req_skills = ["algorithms","math","java","reactjs","csharp","aws"], people = [["algorithms","math","java"],["algorithms","math","reactjs"],["java","csharp","aws"],["reactjs","csharp"],["csharp","math"],["aws","java"]]
Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

1 <= req_skills.length <= 16
1 <= people.length <= 60
1 <= people[i].length, req_skills[i].length, people[i][j].length <= 16
Elements of req_skills and people[i] are (respectively) distinct.
req_skills[i][j], people[i][j][k] are lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.

```python
class Solution:
    # Time O(people * 2^skill)
    # Space O(2^skill)
    def smallestSufficientTeam(self, skills: List[str], people: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(skills)
        m = len(people)
        keys = {v:i for i, v in enumerate(skills)}
        dp = {0:[]}
        for i, p in enumerate(people):
            # Encoding the current skill of this people
            curSkill = 0
            for skill in p:
                if skill in keys:
                    curSkill |= 1 << keys[skill]
            # We can't itetrate the dic while modifying it
            curItems = list(dp.items())
            # Do the knapsack search
            for skill_set, team in curItems: # Search the current skill combination we had
                combinedSkills = curSkill | skill_set
                if combinedSkills == skill_set:
                    continue # This means current people doesn't affect previous res, it's unnecessary
                if combinedSkills not in dp or len(dp[combinedSkills]) > len(team) + 1:
                    dp[combinedSkills] = team + [i]
        return dp[(1 << n) -1]
