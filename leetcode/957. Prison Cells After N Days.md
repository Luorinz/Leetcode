### 957. Prison Cells After N Days

### medium

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: `cells[i] == 1` if the `i`-th cell is occupied, else `cells[i] == 0`.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after `N` days (and `N` such changes described above.)

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `cells.length == 8`
2. `cells[i]` is in `{0, 1}`
3. `1 <= N <= 10^9`

            for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
                cells2[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            cells = cells2;
        }
        return cells;

            for (int i = 1; i < cells.length-1; i++) {
                temp[i] = cells[i-1] == cells[i+1] ? 1: 0;
            }
            cells = temp;
            if (map.containsKey(Arrays.toString(cells))) {
                N %= map.get(Arrays.toString(cells)) - N;
            }
        }
        return cells;
    }
}
