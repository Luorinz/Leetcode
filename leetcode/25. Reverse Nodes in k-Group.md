### 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: 'ListNode', k: 'int') -> 'ListNode':
        cur = head
        count = 0
        # Found the kth node
        while cur != None and count != k:
            cur = cur.next
            count += 1
        
        # if successfully find the kth node
        if count == k:
            cur = self.reverseKGroup(cur, k)
            # The process of reversing
            # Make kth node to be head k times
            while count > 0:
                temp = head.next
                head.next = cur
                cur = head
                head = temp
                count -= 1
            # replace the head with the reversed starting node
            head = cur
        return head
            
```
