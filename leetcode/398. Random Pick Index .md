# 398. Random Pick Index
### medium
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);


```Java
class Solution {
    // O n time O 1 space
    // if we have multiple 5, say 5,5,5,5
    // when we meet the first 5, P(1) = [0, 1) = 1, 
    // for the second, the probability of picking it is P(2) = [0, 2) = 1/2
    // P(3) = [0, 3) = 1/3, P(4) = 1/4
    // The probability of still picking first 5 is 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/ 4
    // Thus the probability is evenly distributed in this case.
    int[] nums;
    Random rnd;
    public Solution(int[] _nums) {
        nums = _nums;
        rnd = new Random();
    }
    
    public int pick(int target) {
        int res = -1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != target) continue;
            if (rnd.nextInt(++count) == 0) res = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
