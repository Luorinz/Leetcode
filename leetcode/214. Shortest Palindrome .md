# 214. Shortest Palindrome
### Hard
Given a string s, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:

Input: "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"

```python
class Solution:
    # Recursive 
    # s[0:j] is the maximum non-unique letters from left
    # s[j:n] is the minimum part where contains unique letters that can only be got from inserting
    # Since each step is optimal,  we can simply handle the middle part of s[0:j] recursively and add the suffix to it.
    def shortestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                i += 1
        print(s[:i])
        if i == n:
            return s
        suffix = s[i:]
        return suffix[::-1] + self.shortestPalindrome(s[:i]) + suffix
