# 126. Word Ladder II
### hard
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
Example 1:

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

    # BFS O 26^l * m *n time O m*n space

        level = set([beginWord])
        # parents is a map of a word to its parents
        parents = collections.defaultdict(set)
        # until we don't run out of candidatees or we don't get endWord as destination
        while level and endWord not in parents:

            next_level = collections.defaultdict(set)

                        temp = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                        # point the child to its father, since it's bfs, we get shortest path
                        # which means the children might have multiple parents and the distance is always 1
                        if temp in dic and temp not in parents:
                            next_level[temp].add(word)
            level = next_level
            # update the parents dict with dict1.update(dict2)
            parents.update(next_level)
        res = [[endWord]]
        # construct the result
        while res and res[0][0] != beginWord:
            res = [[parent] + r for r in res for parent in parents[r[0]]]
        return res
