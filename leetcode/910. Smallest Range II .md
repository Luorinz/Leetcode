# 910. Smallest Range II
### medium
Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).

After this process, we have some array B.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1], K = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: B = [1]
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,10], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: B = [2,8]
Example 3:

Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: B = [4,6,3]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000
0 <= K <= 10000


```python
class Solution(object):
    # Onlogn time O 1 space
    # In ideal case to shorten the interval, we can split the array into 2 parts, 
    # In the left part we add K to every element, in the right part, we minus K to every element
    # For every element in each part, we can conclude that for i < j < l, we have i+k < j+k < l+k
    # If we minus k for j, we might have j-k < i+k < l+k
    # Thus the range might get bigger.
    # So in this case we try to find the place where splits the array
    # First we set the base case to be min - k, max - k
    # Then we keep broadening the left +k part by
    # for each A[i], A[i-1], assume A[i] is the split
    # Since we assume that the array starts from +k, then the left board should be A[0] + k
    # If the new left bound exceed, which is A[i] - k, then we take the new boundery as left bound
    # Same to the right bound. The base case is A[n-1] - k, if the new bound exceed, then we take the new boundery.
    # So we have left = min(A[0]+k, A[i]-k), right = max(A[n-1]-k, A[i-1]+k)
    def smallestRangeII(self, A, K):
        A.sort()
        minVal = A[0]
        maxVal = A[-1]
        # worst possible result
        res = maxVal - minVal
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            res = min(res, max(maxVal-K, A[i-1]+K) - min(minVal+K, A[i]-K))
        return res
