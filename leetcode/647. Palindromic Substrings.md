Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```



**Note:**

1. The input string length won't exceed 1000.

   ```python
   class Solution(object):
       def countSubstrings(self, S):
           # O(n2)
           # Expand to left and right
           ans = 0
           for i in range(len(S)):
               for j in range(2):  # Considering odd and even cases
                   left = i
                   right = left + j
                   while left >= 0 and right < len(S) and S[left] == S[right]:
                       ans += 1
                       left -= 1
                       right += 1
           return ans
   ```
