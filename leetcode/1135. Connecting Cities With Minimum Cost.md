# 1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost
### medium
There are N cities numbered from 1 to N.

You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
Example 2:



Input: N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= connections.length <= 10000
1 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= N
0 <= connections[i][2] <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]

```python
class Solution:
    # union find nlogn time n space
    # with path compression and union by rank
    def minimumCost(self, N: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        parents = [x for x in range(N)]
        rank = [1 for _ in range(N)]
        
        # path compression find
        def find(u):
            while u != parents[u]:
                parents[u] = parents[parents[u]]
                u = parents[u]
            return u
        
        # group by rank union
        def union(u, v):
            rootU, rootV = find(u), find(v)
            if rootU == rootV:  # If already in the same group, we don't count it
                return False
            if rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]:
                rootU, rootV = rootV, rootU
            parents[rootV] = rootU
            rank[rootU] += rank[rootV]
            return True
        
        connections.sort(key=lambda x:x[2]) # sort by the distance
        res = 0
        for u, v, val in connections:
            if union(u-1, v-1):
                res += val  # Only udpate res when new item added to the group
        temp = [find(x) for x in parents]
        groups = len({find(x) for x in parents})
        return res if groups == 1 else -1
