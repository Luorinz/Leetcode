# 322. Coin Change
### medium
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.



```Java
class Solution1 {
    // DP permutation based 
    // O n * amount time O amount space
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        // dp here means how many coins we need to get certain amount
        int max = amount + 1;
        int[] dp = new int[max+1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, max+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        // iterate through the num of results we get certain amount
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            // iterate throught the coins we have
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                if (coins[j] <= i) dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i-coins[j]]+1);
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount? -1: dp[amount];
    }

}

class Solution {
    //  DP combination based(optimized)
    // O n * amount time O amount space
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount+1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int coin: coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin]+1);
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount? -1: dp[amount];
    }
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    # amount * n time amount space
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for _ in range(amount+1)]
        for i in range(1, amount+1):
            dp[i] = float('inf')
            for coin in coins:
                if coin <= i:
                    dp[i] = min(1 + dp[i-coin], dp[i])
        if dp[amount] == float('inf'):
            return -1
        return dp[amount]
```
