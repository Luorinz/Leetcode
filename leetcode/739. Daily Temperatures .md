# 739. Daily Temperatures
### medium
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

```python
class Solution:
    # Mono-stack
    # On time On space
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(T)        
        stack, res = [], [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            while stack and T[i] >= T[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            res[i] = 0 if not stack else stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)
        return res
