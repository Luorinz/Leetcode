# 450. Delete Node in a BST
### medium
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

   / \
  2   6

    4   7


```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # O logn time O logn space
    # Recursion
    # recursively find the root to delete
    # 3 edge cases
    # if no children, then simply return None
    # if 1 left child, then find the predecessor, swap, and delete the predecessor
    # if 1 right child, then find the successor, swap, and delete the successor
    # in common case, a node has both children, in this case we can find the predecessor as newNode or successor as new Node
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        if root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        elif root.val < key:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        else:
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                root = None
            elif root.left:
                root.val = self.getPrev(root)
                root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, root.val)
            else:
                root.val = self.getNext(root)
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, root.val)
        return root
    def getPrev(self, root):
        temp = root.left
        while temp.right:
            temp = temp.right
        return temp.val
