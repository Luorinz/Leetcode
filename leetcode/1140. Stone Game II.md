# 1140. Stone Game II
### medium
Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 
 

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 100
1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4

class Solution:
    # top down dp
    # On time On 
    # dp(ind, m) stands for the min points cur player can get
    # If we can get the rest stones all, then return the presum[i](means we can get all stones to the right)
    # If not, we search all possible choices of j, and continue searching with updating the i and m
    # then we find the minimum of points next player can get
    # then return piles[i] - res, which is all stones to the right - minimum stones opponent can get, which is our maximm score.
