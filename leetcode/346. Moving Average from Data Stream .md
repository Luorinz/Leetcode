# 346. Moving Average from Data Stream
### easy
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example:

MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3

```java
class MovingAverage {
    // O 1 time, O size sapce
    int ind, count;
    int[] window;
    long sum;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        window = new int[size];
        ind = 0;
        count = 0;
        sum = 0;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (count < window.length) count++;
        sum -= window[ind];
        sum += val;
        window[ind] = val;
        ind = (ind + 1) % window.length;
        return (double)sum/count;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```
