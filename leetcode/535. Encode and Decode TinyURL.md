> Note: This is a companion problem to the [System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/) problem: [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

```python
class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
        self.long_short = {}
        self.short_long = {}
        
        
    def encode(self, longUrl):
        import random
        while longUrl not in self.long_short:
            short = ""
            for _ in range(6):
                short += random.choice(self.alphabet)
            if short not in self.short_long:
                self.long_short[longUrl] = short
                self.short_long[short] = longUrl
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + short
        

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        return self.short_long[shortUrl[-6:]]
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```
