# 1162. As Far from Land as Possible
### Medium
Given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
Example 2:



Input: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
 

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

    # BFS
    # start bfs from each 1, and found the deepest level bsf can reach.
    def maxDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        q = collections.deque()
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    q.append([i, j])
        if len(q) == m*n:
            return -1
        res = 0
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            for _ in range(size):
                i, j = q.popleft()
                for dx, dy in [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]:
                    tempX, tempY = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= tempX < m and 0 <= tempY < n and grid[tempX][tempY] == 0:
                        q.append([tempX, tempY])
                        grid[tempX][tempY] = 1
            res += 1
        return res - 1
