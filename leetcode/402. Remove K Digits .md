# 402. Remove K Digits
### medium
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

```java
class Solution {
    // mono stack On time On space
    // keep the str in increasing order and count the poped element
    // if we didn't delete enough element we delete from the end
    // also be careful about leading 0
    public String removeKdigits(String num, int k) {
        if (num == null || num.length() <= k) return "0";
        int n = num.length();
        int count = 0;
        Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = num.charAt(i);
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && c < stack.peek() && count < k) {
                stack.pop();
                count++;
            }
            if (stack.isEmpty() && c == '0') continue;
            stack.push(c);
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            if (count < k) {
                count++;
                stack.pop();
                continue;
            }
            sb.insert(0, stack.pop());
        }
        return sb.length() == 0? "0" : sb.toString();
    }
}
