# 1122. Relative Sort Array
### easy
Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2.  Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
 

Constraints:

arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
Each arr2[i] is distinct.
Each arr2[i] is in arr1.

```python
class Solution1:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        s = set(arr2)
        temp = [x for x in arr1 if x in s]
        temp2 = [x for x in arr1 if x not in s]
        temp2.sort()
        temp.sort(key=lambda x:arr2.index(x))
        temp += temp2
        return temp
    
class Solution:
    # O nlogn time
    # Since we only have 1000 elements here, we can just use 1000 + x as its key.
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:  
        dic = {v:i for i, v in enumerate(arr2)}
        return sorted(arr1, key=lambda x: dic.get(x, 1000 + x))
