# 727. Minimum Window Subsequence
### hard
Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Example 1:

Input: 
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
Output: "bcde"
Explanation: 
"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.
 

Note:

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range [1, 20000].
The length of T will be in the range [1, 100].

class Solution:
    # DP O n2 time O n2 space
    # dp[i][j] means, With T[0:i] and S[0:j], the starting index of target substring
    def minWindow(self, S: str, T: str) -> str:
        m = len(T)
        n = len(S)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
        # Represent the index itself, when T[i-1] first equals S[i-1], then the starting index would be the index itself
        for j in range(n+1):
            dp[0][j] = j+1
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if T[i-1] == S[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
        start, l = 0, float('inf')
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if dp[m][j] != 0:
                if j - dp[m][j] + 1 < l:
                    start = dp[m][j] - 1
                    l = j - dp[m][j] + 1
        return "" if l == float('inf') else S[start:start+l]
