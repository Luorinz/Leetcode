# 666. Path Sum IV
### medium
If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.
 

Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary tree with the depth smaller than 5, you need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

Example 1:

Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
 

Example 2:

Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is: 
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.


```python

class Solution:
    # On time On space
    # Use hashMap to store the nodes. Same as tree traversal.
    def pathSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        self.dic = {}
        self.res = 0
        for num in nums:
            key = num // 10
            val = num % 10
            self.dic[key] = val
        self.helper(11, 0)
        return self.res
    def helper(self, rootKey, curSum):
        if rootKey not in self.dic:
            return 
        curLevel = rootKey // 10
        curPos = rootKey % 10
        leftKey = (curLevel+1) * 10 + (curPos*2-1)
        rightKey = (curLevel+1) * 10 + (curPos*2)
        curSum += self.dic[rootKey]
        if not leftKey in self.dic and not rightKey in self.dic:
            self.res += curSum        
        if leftKey in self.dic:
            self.helper(leftKey, curSum)
        if rightKey in self.dic:
            self.helper(rightKey, curSum)
