# 296. Best Meeting Point
### Hard
A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group. The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

Example:

Input: 

1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 6 

Explanation: Given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):
             The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance 
             of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.


```python
class Solution:
    # Find the median of all houses.
    # Proof: totalX = |x1 - m| + |x2-m| + ... + |xn-m|
    # Derivative of totalX = -1 + 1 + -1 + ...
    # Since we want the derivative to be 0, thus, the number of -1 and 1 should equal   
    # Thus we should have half of the xn smaller than m and half bigger, which is median
    # Same idea with the totalY.
    # Thus we calculate the total distance of each point to the median point.
    # Here we optimize it to Omn, by wisely add the points to the list. Since we don't actually care about the exact location, nor we care about the mapping of each x and y of the house
