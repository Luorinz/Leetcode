# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
## hard
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

```java

class Solution1 {
    // simulate money in hand
    // buy - money; sell + money
    // O 2n time O 1 space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null) return 0;
        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell1 = 0, sell2 = 0;
        for (int price: prices) {
            buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + price);
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + price);
            System.out.println(buy1+" "+sell1+" "+buy2+" "+sell2);
        }
        return sell2;
        
    }
}

class Solution {
    // dp
    // extends to k transaction times
    // O kn time O 1 space, k = times of transaction 
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0) return 0;
        int m = 2;
        int n = prices.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m+1][n];
        for (int i=0; i<m+1; i++) {
            int tempMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) dp[i][j] = 0;
                else {
                    int prev = 0;
                    if (j >= 2) prev = dp[i-1][j-2];// status before last transaction
                    tempMax = Math.max(tempMax, prev - prices[j-1]);
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j-1], tempMax + prices[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n-1];
    }
}
