# 986. Interval List Intersections
### medium
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

 

Example 1:



Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length < 1000
0 <= B.length < 1000
0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9

    // O A + B time O min(A, B) space
    public class Pair{
        int start;
        int end;
        public Pair(int x, int y) {
            this.start = x; 
            this.end = y;
        }

    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        List<Pair> res = new LinkedList<>();
        int i = 0, j = 0, ind = 0;
        while (i < A.length && j < B.length) {
            Pair a = new Pair(A[i][0], A[i][1]);
            Pair b = new Pair(B[j][0], B[j][1]);
            // find the overlap, use to compare
            int head = Math.max(a.start, b.start);
            int tail = Math.min(a.end, b.end);
            if (head <= tail) {
                res.add(new Pair(head, tail));
            }
            // update index
            if (a.end == tail) i++;
            if (b.end == tail) j++;
        }
        int[][] ret = new int[res.size()][2];
        for (Pair p: res) {
            ret[ind++] = new int[] {p.start, p.end};
        }
        return ret;
